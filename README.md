# ðŸŽ“ Student Profile Management System (SPMS)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a **Student Profile Management System (SPMS)** built from scratch with limited prior experience in Python and software development. The main goal was not just to build a working system, but to **learn by doing**â€”exploring concepts like file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), GUI development with Tkinter, and data visualization with libraries like `matplotlib` or `pandas`.

As undergraduate students, we challenged ourselves to understand how to structure a real-world application while learning key programming concepts through hands-on experience.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Authentication System** for Admin and Student roles
- **Admin Dashboard** for managing student data:
  - Add, update, delete student profiles
  - Manage academic grades and extracurricular activities
- **Student Dashboard** for viewing personal, academic, and ECA records
- **File Handling** using `.txt` files to simulate a simple database:
  - `users.txt`, `grades.txt`, `eca.txt`, `passwords.txt`
- **Performance Analytics** (optional module)
  - Grade trends, alerts for low performance, ECA impact using `matplotlib/pandas`
