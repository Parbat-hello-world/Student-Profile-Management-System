#  Student Profile Management System (SPMS)

##  Project Description

This project is a **Student Profile Management System (SPMS)** built from scratch with limited prior experience in Python and software development. The main goal was not just to build a working system, but to **learn by doing**â€”exploring concepts like file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), GUI development with Tkinter, and data visualization with libraries like `matplotlib` or `pandas`.

As undergraduate students, we challenged ourselves to understand how to structure a real-world application while learning key programming concepts through hands-on experience.
